think about how to handle additional npc information - does this go into a separate file? Does this go into the map?

bug: NPC will first move to melee, then if you move away, NPC will switch to ranged

make music stop victory, once the song is done. how to do this?
perhaps just state variable will take care of this?

figure out a good way to get corpse drawn and not rely on logic during drawing.
i.e. have a trigger once state is dead, update current image and do not update it again.
same thing for poisoned or sleeping. poisoned could be current image rendered slightly green.
create images before, or draw on demand?

want to implement tiny tool tips next to cross-hairs to indicate something about target.

want to implement changing cursors

need to implement attack remembering last target.

Map stuff -
so maps have layers kind of with furniture and inventory. how about I have map tile that have other contents?
Or I just draw village completely without second layer.
