bug: NPC will first move to melee, then if you move away, NPC will switch to ranged

make music stop victory, once the song is done. how to do this?
perhaps just state variable will take care of this?

figure out a good way to get corpse drawn and not rely on logic during drawing.
i.e. have a trigger once state is dead, update current image and do not update it again.
same thing for poisoned or sleeping. poisoned could be current image rendered slightly green.
