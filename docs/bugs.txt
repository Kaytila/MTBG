2022-11-29  FIXED game initialize does not calculate visibility correct
2022-11-29  FIXED Inventory does not work twice?
2022-11-29  FIXED Drop into the world does no longer work
2022-11-29  music does stop rather abruptly - perhaps turn off the turn counter for switch from victory back to map?

2022-12-31  commandsuccessmachine does not play hit sound

2023-01-06  FIXED LOS calculation is off somewhere. Need to experiment more with terrain types and probably roll my own
            LOS calculation. sigh.
2023-01-10  FIXED NPCs sometimes are not drawn correctly, if I do not calculate the UI position during drawing, sometimes they
            disappear.
2023-01-10  FIXED calculation of black tiles (i.e. outside of the map) is not correct when player moves adjecient
2023-01-14  FIXED somehow schedules for all NPCs are being checked instead of the ones on the current map.
2023-01-20  FIXED on map switch, getWeatherSystem returns null - wonder how and why
2023-01-22  FIXED drawing tiles has a bug if a map is not a rectangle the map 2d array will not work of course
2023-01-31  moveTo for Player is horribly broken
2023-02-08  FIXED NPCs - using prototypes which to spawn during map does make it problematic. they share traits they should not.
2023-02-08  FIXED patrol is broken again  - not the faintest idea why.
2023-02-10  FIXED LoS is broken when looking from east to west. Why?

2023-02-23  FIXED missile combat appears to make the cpu speed up a lot
2023-03-07  FIXED player lightsource is ignored
2023-03-07  FIXED light source range calculation is off
2023-03-08  FIXED light source range calculation only works if the light source is visible on the map, need to change
            calculation of brightened factor to go either all over the map or to get an additional range outside of
            visibility
2023-04-02  FIXED npcs are being initialized even if the map is not active. this caused a schedule to break as a
            non-properly initialized npc was causing a draw error
2023-05-10  when moving crosshair with keyboard, you cannot get past what you should - if you use mouse, you can get
            one step beyond.
2023-09-02  FIXED when switching maps - player is not redrawn, this is because of NPC that has switched before
2023-09-02  when a npc switches maps, not quite sure where it ends up at this is still a problem. perhaps dont allow that
2023-09-30  FIXED Dialog can only be opened once, not again. Closing with ESC works, x-ing creates issue
2023-11-25  when command is active, other commands can be run on top creating a huge mess. need to make sure that this
            is handled generally in the framework, not on command by command basis.
2023-11-27  FIXED closing spellbook always assumes there is an active spell afterwards.
2024-01-15  drag'n'drop onto a wall works, kind of - wall does not accept it but item is gone anyawys
2024-02-21  FIXED daynight cycle works, but light sources are currently ignored. Check in paintComponent whether this handled
2024-04-24  for some reason furniture can be walked on. blocked should be false because of it during init.
2024-04-24: initial implementation of bufferedLense has an edge case issue.
2024-06-23: PC missiles are handled correctly, but NPC missiles are not.
            it is actually normal that NPC missiles are drawn after PC has moved already. HitOrMiss is drawn correctly,
            but the whole paint part (where missile starts and where it ends is currently incorrect. highlight drawing
            is correct however. Yes, it is that case.
2024-06-26: when killing an enemy, PC will still shoot at the same target even if switching targets. target is not
            cleared properly.
2024-07-11: FIXED IdleTimer no longer works after deactivating or iconifying game.
2025-04-23: FIXED in MapEditor, maptilepane did not calculate scrollbar properly. adding the #ensureIndexIsVisible to
            the listselection listener for it solved it.
2025-04-23: FIXED long standing bug in the buttons - I am drawing the button text anyways, no need to set the label.
2025-04-26: In MapEditor, there is a bug in selection with highlighting of the selectedItem and rather de-highlighting
            the other entries.
2025-05-02: MapEditor, adding an npc after dbl clicking a maptile does not work. You need to add a tile first, then you
            can add an npc again.
