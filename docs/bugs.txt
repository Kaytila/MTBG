2022-11-02  FIXED keyboard movement does not repaint fast enough - need to check where the delay comes from.
            Delay came from delay per NPC for highlighting. Solution, turn off highlighting.

2022-11-29  FIXED game initialize does not calculate visibility correct
2022-11-29  FIXED Inventory does not work twice?
2022-11-29  FIXED Drop into the world does no longer work
2022-11-29  music does stop rather abruptly - perhaps turn off the turn counter for switch from victory back to map?

2023-01-06  FIXED LOS calculation is off somewhere. Need to experiment more with terrain types and probably roll my own
            LOS calculation. sigh.
2023-01-10  FIXED NPCs sometimes are not drawn correctly, if I do not calculate the UI position during drawing, sometimes they
            disappear.
2023-01-10  FIXED calculation of black tiles (i.e. outside of the map) is not correct when player moves adjecient
2023-01-14  FIXED somehow schedules for all NPCs are being checked instead of the ones on the current map.
2023-01-20  FIXED on map switch, getWeatherSystem returns null - wonder how and why
2023-01-22  FIXED drawing tiles has a bug if a map is not a rectangle the map 2d array will not work of course
2023-01-31  moveTo for Player is horribly broken
2023-02-08  FIXED NPCs - using prototypes which to spawn during map does make it problematic. they share traits they should not.
2023-02-08  FIXED patrol is broken again  - not the faintest idea why.
2023-02-10  FIXED LoS is broken when looking from east to west. Why?

2023-03-07  FIXED player lightsource is ignored
2023-03-07  FIXED light source range calculation is off
2023-03-08  light source range calculation only works if the light source is visible on the map, need to change

            visibility
2023-04-02  FIXED npcs are being initialized even if the map is not active. this caused a schedule to break as a
            non-properly initialized npc was causing a draw error
2023-05-10  when moving crosshair with keyboard, you cannot get past what you should - if you use mouse, you can get
            one step beyond.
2023-09-02  FIXED when switching maps - player is not redrawn, this is because of NPC that has switched before
2023-09-02  when a npc switches maps, not quite sure where it ends up at this is still a problem. perhaps dont allow that
2023-09-30  FIXED Dialog can only be opened once, not again. Closing with ESC works, x-ing creates issue
2023-11-25  when command is active, other commands can be run on top creating a huge mess. need to make sure that this
            is handled generally in the framework, not on command by command basis.
2023-11-27  FIXED closing spellbook always assumes there is an active spell afterwards.
